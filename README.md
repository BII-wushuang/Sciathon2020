# Sciathon 2020
http://sciathon.org/project/group-kolodziejczyk/

In the spirit of the Lindau Meetings, our group has strived to democratize and make accessible one of the most exciting fields in computer science and physics. By building onto existing open source frameworks and our diverse backgrounds in science, we have constructed an introductory look into quantum computing that is accessible to people of all educational backgrounds. Best of all? It has cats.
