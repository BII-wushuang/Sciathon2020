# Sciathon Webinar: Presenting Results Online
## Presented by [Brian Malow](http://www.sciencecomedian.com/about-brian/)

### Setting up tips

- Audio is more important than video for communication. So ensure that the microphone is working fine.
- Eye level around 2/3 of the screen. Appropriate look space.
- Wide Screen (landscape instead of portrait).
- Look at the camera. Try to move the window near to the camera so that you can maintain natural eye contact while looking at the audience.
- Lens flare for spectacles.
- Background composition.
- Filtering out ambient noise. Suggestion: suppressing noise by wrapping soft foam around the microphone.

### Advice for presentation and communication
- Be natural and not tensed up.
- Enthusiasm and passion.
- [Anecdote of Feynman](https://www.montessorieducation.com/blog/the-wonders-i-know-im-going-to-find): translate as best as possible what one is saying into some reality the audience can connect with.
- Do not just go over factual information without putting thoughts into the insights.
- The goal is not dumbing down the science but speaking in a language that the audience would be familiar with.
- Analogies and anecdotes to connect with people.
- Implications (for example what are the consequences of say a 1 degree increase in temperature).
- Do not be harsh on yourself if faced with silence. Try to get over the awkwardness.
- Avoid unnecessary technical details, especially since the presentation is limited to 2 minutes.
